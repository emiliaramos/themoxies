        <h2>Repair Damaged Hair!!</h2>
        <p>Are you addicted to hair bleach and flat irons?  
        These are just some of the many stresses that lead to damaged hair. 
        Other culprits include lack of moisture, heat damage, and chemical damage.
        Less than perfect locks are hassle to deal with, 
        but fortunately there are plenty of ways to restore your hair health. 
        Here are some tips for repairing damaged hair, 
        so you can bring those strands back to life:</p>
       <h2>Deep Conditioning Treatments</h2>
       <p>When dealing with damaged hair, 
       you must first find the root of the problem. 
       Once you know the cause of the damage, you can focus on the solution. 
       A deep conditioning treatment does wonders for 
       all types of damage and is the first step towards healthier, 
       happier hair. These treatments come in all shapes 
       and sizes and can be found at your local beauty store or supermarket. 
       They immediately condition and moisturize the hair, while minimizing
       dryness. This Creme of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning 
       Treatment strengthens the hair and restores essential moisture.
       Popular brands that have great deep treatments include Organix, 
       Shea Moisture, and Carol Daughter.</p>
       <h2>Homemade Treatments</h2>
       <p>On a tight budget? You can use common ingredients to create 
       homemade conditioning treatments. 
       Three of the most popular do-it-yourself treatments for 
       damaged hair include items that you probably already have in your 
       pantry. An egg treatment can restore and nourish your hair, 
       and is simply made from 2 egg yolks, 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil, 
       and 1/8 cup of water. For a hot oil treatment, which calms and softens
       frizzy strands, heat up 1/4 cup of olive oil and apply it to your hair. 
       Just be careful not to make it too hot! If you’re more adventurous, 
       you can try the mayonnaise treatment and coat your hair in 1/2 cup of 
       the condiment. Leave these treatments in your hair for about fifteen 
       minutes and then wash it out with cool water. These are just some of 
       the many creations you can whip up right in the comfort of your own
       home!On a tight budget? You can use common ingredients to create

       <h2>Moisturizing Products</h2>
       <p>Be careful of the types of products you use. 
       Many products can continue to dry out your hair and
       cause even more havoc. If your hair is dry, you’re probably no 
       stranger to heat. If this is the case, you must get a heat protector
       product which will safeguard your hair from heat damage. 
       The TRESemme Heat Tamer Spray is known as one of the best 
       in the beauty market, and it’s a great steal. Also look for 
       a split end sealing serum, which protects against split ends.</p>
       <h2>Natural Hairstyles</h2>
       <p>In order to avoid damage caused by over-styling your hair, 
       consider some natural hairdos that don’t require heating tools
       or too many products. Choose a hairstyle that can set overnight.
       In the morning, your hair will look fabulous and healthy. 
       If you seek a long-term protective style, and have a bit more 
       cash to splurge, get box braids as seen on Solange Knowles. 
       If your hair is really damaged, then consider getting a haircut.
       Begin with a fresh start and treat your hair right when growing it
       out.</p>
       <h2>Healthy Lifestyle and Supplements</h2>
       <p>Healthy hair comes with a healthy lifestyle. 
       So, continue drink up your daily dose of water because 
       dehydration can cause dry hair. Try a supplement like Biotin, 
       which helps with the growth and repair of your hair.
Damaged hair is hard to manage, but it’s definitely reversible. 
Whether you choose treatments, protective hairstyles, or get a major trim,
be patient and your hair will go back to the strong, bouncy,
and moisturized texture it once was.
