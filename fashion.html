        <h2>Business Casual Trends</h2>
        <p>It is that time of the year again, the one that everyone has been 
        waiting for. Yes, it is  now time to pull out that printed summer 
        dress and tan wedges that you have been dying to show off all year. 
        But wait; let us not get too far ahead of ourselves. It is a new year
        and we all want to look amazing this summer, but there is still work 
        and internships to attend. Khyra Thomas, a sophomore at Howard University, 
        comments on the subject of fashion in the workplace: ' It is so frustrating!
        I want to look cute in the summertime, but it is tough when I have an 
        internship that requires me to dress in business casual attire. '</p>
        <p>Now the question presents itself: how does one remain fashionable 
        in the workplace? Well, it is all about bright colors and chic prints 
        this year. According to the Pantone Fashion Color Report, 
        this year 's top trending colors are 
        <h7 style= "color: #F6C324">freesia</h7> (an eye-popping yellow), 
        <h7 style= "color: #E8733D">celosia orange</h7> (an upbeat and rich orange), 
        and <h7 style="color: #E04951"> cayenne </h7>(a bright easy red). 
        There are also pastels such as <h7 style="color: #9B90C8">violet 
        tulip </h7> (a soft romantic violet), 
        <h7 style="color:#8DAED7">placid blue</h7> (a calm and peaceful blue),
        and <h7 style="color:#97C1A1">hemlock</h7> (a summery pastel green). 
        Among these colors there is also sand, a <h7 style="color: #CDAB81">
        carefree neutral. </h7>
        This are the various colors that were named in the color 
        report for this year. These colors can be played with in outfits 
        for the work place. When dressing in your khakis or nude suit, dress 
        it up with a button up mimicking the color of Cayenne. 
        It is bright enough for the work place, yet still professional.</p>
        <p>This summer, it is time to take off that basic black pencil skirt 
        and rock full skirts, which are trending. These skirts can be 
        paired with blouses for the workplace, and you can dress them 
        up with heels. This skirt is the perfect color for the summer, 
        but is not
        too much for the office. This skirt goes well with in 
        any color, but I would say stay away from full patterned skirts,
        especially for the office, as it may be a bit be too much.</p>
        <p>Now it is
        time to kick off those black pumps and put on a pair of 
        sling back heels. These heels are perfect for creating a fashion 
        statement in the summertime. These heels featured above are none
        other than the Michael Kors Elisa Sling back Pumps; they complement 
        any outfit without looking overdone.</p>
        <p>As for suits, classic black is the safest choice when at the office, 
        but it is time to branch out with printed suits. These suits are an
        undeniably bold fashion statement for the office. The printed 
        blazer can be paired with basic black skinny trousers, and printed
        trousers can be styled with a basic black or white button-up.</p>
        <p>With summer finally here, it is
        time to ditch that basic black suit and off your style in the office.
        The next time you are
        getting dressed up for that 7 am commute, 
        throw a pale yellow blouse on over that suit, switch out your heels 
        for a pair of patterned flats, and jazz up that dress with a printed 
        blazer. Summer is a time for vibrant color and patterns, 
        and that does not
        have to be taken away from you just because you are a working lady,
        so go show off your fashion in the office! 
        When you look good, you feel great; 
        and that job or internship will feel that much more amazing.</p></div>
